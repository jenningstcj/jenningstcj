## Architect/Senior Engineer

I am a fullstack engineer and architect who has a broad background in technology and is able to bring a lot of expertise to the table.  Early on in my career I was a systems administrator maintaining servers and enterprise software.  Later on I became a network engineer and was Network+ and Cisco CCNA certified.  However, my real passion is building things that help people and provide value.  I have been a full-time software engineer for over a decade.  In that time I have used a plethora of technologies to solve problems including, but not limited to C#/.NET, Node/Express, TypeScript, Angular, AngularJS, React, AWS Services, Azure Cloud, Ionic, React Native, Flutter, PostgreSQL, MS SQL, MySQL, DynamoDB, SNS, SQS, SES, ECS, EKS, EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, and more.  I have architected large systems and lead teams implementing those systems and enjoyed teaching and mentoring my teams along the way.  Most of all I have enjoyed seeing the success my work as brought to countless clients.

**Serverless Microservices through Serverless Framework**

Microservices using serverless technologies are popular for many great reasons. The benefits of using serverless technologies to handle scale and segregation of concerns are tremendous. Serverless Framework is a great way to manage you serverless apps and infrastructure and make it easy to prevent vendor lock-in. In this session we will look at using Serverless Framework to build microservices on both AWS and Azure and design patterns to consider along the way to make it easy to scale your code.

**What Time Is It Anyway?**

Handling date and time in our applications can be a complex task with many nuances. How should we handle date time? Should we store local time zone or UTC? Should we store dates and times separately? Should we use Unix time? These are all valid questions and there isn't always a one-size-fits-all solution. In this talk we will take a look at the challenges that date and time present to us, the different scenarios we might run into, and how we might solve them in our applications. We will look at the pros and cons of different approaches and see which approach might be best in various circumstances.

**Write Cleaner JavaScript Today**

JavaScript is being utilized for everything nowadays. As Atwood's Law states, "Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript.". This is because JavaScript is a very easy language to pick up and learn. After all, anyone can open any browser's dev tools and start coding in JavaScript and watch it immediately execute. However, it is also very easy to create a mess with JavaScript. Neat code can easily turn into spaghetti code that is hard to understand. Worse, it can contain all sorts of hidden bugs until runtime. Let us take a look at some language features and techniques that can help clean up our code, make it easier to read, and eliminate bugs
