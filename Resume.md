## Architect/Senior Engineer

I am a fullstack engineer and architect who has a broad background in technology and is able to bring a lot of expertise to the table.  Early on in my career I was a systems administrator maintaining servers and enterprise software.  Later on I became a network engineer and was Network+ and Cisco CCNA certified.  However, my real passion is building things that help people and provide value.  I have been a full-time software engineer for over a decade.  In that time I have used a plethora of technologies to solve problems including, but not limited to .NET, Node, TypeScript, Angular, AngularJS, React, AWS Services, Azure Cloud, Ionic, React Native, Flutter, PostgreSQL, MS SQL, MySQL, and DynamoDB.
